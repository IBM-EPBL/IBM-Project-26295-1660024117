A personal finance app will not only help you with budgeting and accounting but also give you helpful insights about money management.

Also, users can get an analysis of their expenditure in graphical forms. They have an option to set a limit for the amount to be used for that particular month if the limit is exceeded the user will be notified with an email alert.
